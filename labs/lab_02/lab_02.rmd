## Load Data

Let's keep working with the UMD courses and Maryland campaign expense data we used in the pre_lab.

```{r}
umd_courses <- read_rds("data/umd_courses.rds")
maryland_expenses <- read_csv("data/maryland_expenses.csv")
```

## Answer questions

**Q1.** How many departments have offered the courses with "Climate" in the title and at least one seat? Which department has offered the most? **A1. 26; Atmospheric and Oceanic Science**

```{r}
umd_courses |>
filter(str_detect(title, "Climate") & seats >= 1) |>
group_by(department) |>
summarise(classes = n()) |>
arrange(desc(classes))
```

**Q2.** Of the departments listed in A2, which one is the most interesting to you, and why? **A2: Germanic Studies is a surprising one, since it's not a science field.**

**Q3** Which departments have the most courses in the Fall 2023 term? And which departments in that term have at least one syllabus posted? How are the top five departments different in each result?

**A3. Business and Management has the most, with 164, and Music second with 137. 125 departments have at least one syllabus. Economics, for example, features in the second filter and not the first.**

```{r}
umd_courses |>
filter(term == 202308) |>
group_by(department) |>
summarise(classes = n()) |>
arrange(desc(classes))

umd_courses |>
filter(term == 202308 & syllabus_count >= 1) |>
group_by(department) |>
summarise(syllabi = n()) |>
arrange(desc(syllabi))
```

**Q4.** Using the Maryland campaign expenses data, change the datatype of the expenditure_date column so that it is a date and not a chr, saving the result as the same dataframe. Then create a new column for the month based on expenditure_date. Then write code that shows total amount spent each month by Wes Moore's committee (you'll need to search the data to find the exact name). Write a sentence describing the pattern of spending over time. **A4. This code is not working for some reason; seems the same as you had in class so not sure why. R is not finding the column names that should be in the file.**

```{r}
maryland_expenses |>
  mutate(expenditure_date_new = mdy(expenditure_date)) |>
  mutate(month = floor_date(expenditure_date_new, "month")) |>
  filter(committee_name == 'Moore  Wes For Maryland') |>
  group_by(month) |>
  summarise(total_amount = sum(amount))
```

**Q5.** Using case_when(), create a column in the Maryland expenses data called `spending_location` indicating whether each record spent money in Maryland or outside Maryland. For records that are in Maryland, make the new column's value "In-state" and for the others, make it "Out of state". Then write code that shows the total amount of money spent in each category and describe the results. You can do this in one statement or break it up into two statements (saving the new column to your dataframe). **A5 Getting a similar error.**

```{r}
spending_location <-maryland_expenses |>
mutate( 
  state = case_when(
  str_detect(address, "Maryland" ~ "In state"),
  str(address = "NA" ~ "NA"),
  .default = "Out of state")) |>
group_by(spending_location) |>
summarise(total_amount = sum(amount), na.rm=T) |>
  arrange(desc(total_amount))
```

**Q6.** Choose your own adventure: using either the UMD courses or campaign expenses data, ask and answer a question that is different than the previous ones. You can use one of the ones you provided in the pre_lab. **A6. Courses data: What are the departments with the least number of courses in the fall term? Any surprises there? A: Several programs including "Honors" only have one class. Honors is a bit surprising, but I assume honors courses are generally marked/categorized in a different way.\

```{r}
umd_courses |>
filter(term == 202308) |>
group_by(department) |>
summarise(classes = n()) |>
arrange(classes)
